# Git Log

A git repo is a list of commits. Where each commit represents the full state of the repository at a
given point in time.

The `git log` commands shows a history of the commits in a repository.
You can see:

- Who made a commit
- When the commit was made
- What was changed

## A Comit Hash

Each commit has a unique identifier called a "commit hash". This is a long hexadecimal string of characters
that uniquely identifies the commmit.

Example:
5ba786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f

For convenience, we can refer to any commit or change within Git by using the first `7` characters
of its hash.
